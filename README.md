# Suckless

Custom versions of [suckless](https://suckless.org/) software with pre-applied patches, custom keybindings etc.

## Simple Terminal

[Simple terminal](https://st.suckless.org/), otherwise known as *st* is the terminal emulator of my choice. I have 2 patches installed :
* [Gruvbox](https://st.suckless.org/patches/gruvbox/) colorscheme, to go with my neovim setup.
* [Newterm](https://st.suckless.org/patches/newterm/), which allows spawning a new terminal using ```Ctrl+Shift+Return``` in the same CWD as the original st instance.
